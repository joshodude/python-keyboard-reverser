# python-keyboard-reverser
It reverses the text based on the keyboard. `a` will become `'`, `s` will become `;`, `d` will become `l`, etc. It does not support numbers or backslash at the moment.

Requires PySimpleGUI.

### How to use:

Run `keyboard-reverser-gui.py` from your Python interpreter.
Type what you want to be reversed in the input box.
Hit the reverse button.
